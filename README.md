 Help for those that have issues with Rider understanding DirectX

I've had this problem happen a few times, usually when opening my project on a different PC. I get a lot of errors, all in C# files and Rider complaining it doesn't understand what DirectX is and the build always fails to compile from source with a code 6 and little information about the problem.
I found a post on youtrack.jetbrains by a Mikhail Zakharov who posted a great workaround that has saved me a lot of time! It's not the easiest to find so here it is.

Download the cs file in this repo and place in the following file path
